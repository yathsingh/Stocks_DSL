**DOCUMENTATION OF BUILDING PROCESS:**

Phase 1 => Skeleton 
1. Created a base 'template' architecture of folders.
2. Created a basic tokenizer to call as a placeholder.
3. Defined AST nodes.
4. Mock parser and generator to test AST -> Python code pipeline.
5. Create basic simulator for OHLC values and processing them.
6. Created prototype main.py and confirmed pipeline working.

Phase 2 => DSL
1. Defined and locked syntax.
2. Defined valid indicators.
3. Defined operators.
4. Created tokenizer.

Phase 3 => Parser
1. Created AST Nodes.
2. Created token stream (parser helper).
3. Created parser.

Phase 4 => Generator
1. Created generator.

Phase 5 => Backtest
1. Created simulator.
