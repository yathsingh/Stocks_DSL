**DOCUMENTATION OF BUILDING PROCESS:**

Phase 1 => Skeleton setup and pipeline testing to ensure smooth flow
1. Created a base 'template' architecture of folders.
2. Created a basic tokenizer to call as a placeholder.
3. Defined AST nodes.
4. Mock parser and generator to test AST -> Python code pipeline.
5. Create basic simulator for OHLC values and processing them.
6. Created prototype main.py and confirmed pipeline working.

Phase 2 => DSL
1. Well-defined and readable syntax.
2. Defined valid indicators.
3. Defined operators.

Phase 3 => Parser
1. Created AST Nodes
2. Created parser (External Library used: Lark)

Phase 4 =>
