Building Process:

Phase 1 => Skeleton setup and pipeline testing to ensure smooth flow
1. Created a base 'template' architecture of folders.
2. Created a basic tokenizer to call as a placeholder.
3. Defined AST nodes.
4. Mock parser and generator to test AST -> Python code pipeline
5. Create basic simulator for OHLC values and processing them
6. Created prototype main.py and confirmed pipeline working
